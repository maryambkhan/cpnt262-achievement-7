### Code Journal

- I created a projrct via `vue ui` and added eslintrc.js i dont forget to add this file here becouse
  it gave me such trouble.
- I created a project befor this one and ran into problem becouse css was not applying then i noticed 
 that tailwind was not configured right. so deleted the whole project and re-started while i am writing this i feel like
  there was better way to do this i shold have deleted the plugin and added it again.
- I am going to use some of components from  my heckathon project and will add few new.
- I always use same layout for pages this time i am thinking for something new i hope i get it what i am thinking off
- Components:
   - PageHeader
   - PageFooter
   - Cards
   - CallToAction
- I have googled some card layouts for inspiration which i am going to bulid off.
